Add a value-fetching utility.
  input name     # reads name from args, prompts if not supplied
  input arch $(arch)   # reads arch from args, uses default if not supplied

Add a non-interactive option.  Instead of prompting for unknown args, we fail.
Add a no-op option.  This just prints the run commands, it doesn't execute them.
start_image -> start_bootstrap, etc
add a "are you sure, this machine is known broken!" command

LXC:
  lxc-wait should accept a timeout argument
  it should be possible to run multiple lxc-waits and lxc-monitors at once
