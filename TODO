Add a value-fetching utility.
  input name     # reads name from args, prompts if not supplied
  input arch $(arch)   # reads arch from args, uses default if not supplied

Add a non-interactive option.  Instead of prompting for unknown args, we fail.
Add a no-op option.  This just prints the run commands, it doesn't execute them.
run scripts from the rootfs as soon as possible, instead of passing rootfs?
add a "are you sure, this machine is known broken!" command
make networking more flexible
make excellent documentation (using sphinx http://sphinx.pocoo.org ?)


LXC:
  lxc-wait should accept a timeout argument
